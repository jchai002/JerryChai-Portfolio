        <br>
        <p class="description">This is the official business website for Dreamland Mattress, where I was an I.T. consultant. It was built with the static page serving framework Jekyll, and deployed on AWS s3. Because many of Dreamland's customers are Chinese, I designed this website with bilingual support. The content can be switched freely between English and Chinese by clicking on the language option on the navigation bar.</p>

      <br>
      <p class="description">This app takes away the decision fatigue from choosing a lunch spot. Users only have to pick the distance they are willing to travel and a minimum yelp rating, and the app will select a random restaurant that fits the criteria. This app uses the yelp api and the google maps api.</p>
